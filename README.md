# Coding Quiz

## Description

This is a coding quiz to test the user's knowledge on basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In building this quiz, I utilized many concepts taught to me in the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp by Bryan Swarthout.

I used Bootstrap to help make the layout responsive, but also added in some of my own CSS styles to make the quiz page look interesting. I found a great website, Coolors.io, that generates color schemes, and used it to choose colors for this quiz page. I also took the font, Overpass, from Google fonts.
